# Metamaterial Solver

First, you input your input modal (A signal source, noise source)

Thenn you also input your desired frequency response of the material

which shows you the output signal as a plot

And you can select whether to run in CUDA or not (checkbox is gated behind auto CUDA support check)

And let's say you can also select the medium properties as well,

and a menu for customizing the material property so each voxel has a material property

We will have one 2D voxel face as the start of the sound source with the sound source at the center

then the rectangular 3D unit cell of metamaterial

periodic boundary conditions

then a 2D surface with the virtual microphone exactly at the center

optimization happens on an error reduction

we try to reduce the error from the desired frequency response of the material and the actual frequency response collected at the centerpoint of the 2D face on the other side

the error will guide our topology optimizer 

Our topology optimizer will then update the topology to be a continous, periodic shape for the unit cell


## Preliminary Candidates for the wave equation solvers

- Helmholtz single frequency with GMRES
- FDTD with staircase effects taken into consideration for realism
- Shifted krylov shared subspace with indiviudal GMRES thread solvers in multiple parallel branches
- what else?

## Candidates for topology optimization

- SIMP

I dont know what else. 

Constraints: Periodic unit cell, solid geometry must be continous starting from the unit cell surface; no floating solid islands

## Notes

Main author has an RTX 5060 GPU and thought it's a shame not to use it. CUDA is certainly an option here so we make use of the hardware as much as possible
